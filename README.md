Topic Name: Malware Detection Using AI

This project leverages artificial intelligence to detect malware in files using static analysis techniques. Static analysis examines a file's attributes and code without executing it, ensuring a safe and efficient detection process.

Key Features

Data Extraction:
Extract features such as file metadata, opcode sequences, control flow graphs, or byte patterns from the file.

AI-Powered Analysis:
Use machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests) trained on labeled datasets of malware and benign files.
The model identifies patterns and anomalies indicative of malicious behavior.

Advantages of Static Analysis:
Safe: No need to execute potentially dangerous files.
Efficient: Faster than dynamic analysis since it does not simulate runtime behavior.

Workflow:
Preprocessing: Extract features and convert them into a format suitable for the AI model.
Model Training: Train the AI model using a dataset of known malware and benign samples.
Prediction: Classify new files as malicious or benign based on their static attributes.
Challenges
High false-positive rates due to polymorphic and obfuscated malware.
Limited effectiveness against malware that uses advanced evasion techniques.

Applications
Endpoint security tools.
Cloud-based malware scanning.
Integration into antivirus software.

This approach is a foundation for developing secure and intelligent systems to combat malware in various domains.
